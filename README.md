# DISP
DISP is a new system that benefits from both mmdetection's plugin arch and plentiful
features, as well as detection2's efficiency and correctness by using pytorch the right way,
targeting for the state of the art Detection, Instance Segmentation,
Semantic Segmentation, Panoptic Segmentation (and real time 3D Detection
based on state of the art 2D Detection).

## TODO List:

Enhance DISP architecture whenever it is needed.
